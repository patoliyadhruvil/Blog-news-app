      "description": "What It Is: A lifestyle and fashion blog by Emily Schuman, full of all sorts of great posts on everything from fashion/beauty to decor, recipes, work, and reflections on life with her husband and young daughter.\n\nWhy I Love It: I had always heard people talk about this blog, but didn’t start following regularly until a year or two ago. Fashion blogs aren’t usually my thing, but I feel like Emily posts about trendy things in a fun and helpful and accessible way. Her beauty tutorials are also always fascinating and spot-on. More than anything though (I’m realizing a theme here…), I love the posts when she shares about the relationships in her life, and all of the honest ups and downs of navigating life as a new mom.\n\nRecommendations: All of her beauty tutorials/recommendations. Her personal posts. Her DIY projects."
